                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.6
                    ---------------------------------

 * Added string zfill function, thanks to A. Motolla.

 * Added datetime module, thanks to A. Motolla.

 * Added issubclass, thanks to Daniel Gerber

   JSON-RPC 2.0 error dicts ini onRemeoteError (other errors are 
   mapped to JSON-RPC 2.0 format)

 * Enhanced dict initialization: dict(a=1, b=2)

 * Added setFocus function to TextBoxBase to override FocusMixin.setFocus
   because FocusMixin assumes that you called Focus.createFocusable to
   create the input box.

 * Modified bootstrap.py: place absolute path in pyjsbuild.bat file to
   reference python.exe direct (thanks to Rich Newpol) closes #324

 * Added FlowPanel demo from jordanwii showing how you have to use
   a span element to Label to get round a CSS IE hack issue

 * Added support for IfExp (inline if expression)

 * Added support for generator expressions

 * Added support for any statement in class definition

 * Added support backquote

 * Added support for class definition anywhere

 * Re-enabled and fixed up pyv8run.py, which now successfully runs
   LibTest when translated to javascript (and passes 99.95%)

 * added support for Subscript Assignment in class definitions:
   class SubAssignBase(object):
       names['SubAssign'] = 'SubAssign'

 * Added support for generators (yield statement)

 * Added an substantial portion of re module

 * added isReadOnly and getReadOnly functions to FocusMixin, such that
   FocusPanel and FocusWidget both get that functionality (thanks to
   guenter walser)

 * Added --operator-funcs to enable non-number operation such as [1]+[2]

 * Added --inline-code to speedup eq/bool/len (saves expensive function calls)

 * All attributes are accessed as v['attr'] and not as v.attr anymore
   This circumvents a bug in IE with javascript keywords:

   to get event handling.

 * fixed floating point precision in sprintf, now '%.2f' works

 * Added basic implemention of new style decorators and 2.6 style property()

 * Added first port of GChart - http://code.google.com/p/gchart.
   java2py.py converted, then manual update.  Passes syntax check
   but that's about it...

 * Added property()

 * Added staticmethod()

 * Added __pyjamas__.setCompilerOptions()

                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.5p1
                    -----------------------------------

 * Resolved getAbsoluteTop and getAbsoluteLeft in pyjd hulahop, pyjd
   pywebkitgtk, Safari, Mozilla (including 3.5), webkit but NOT IE6
   and NOT pyjd MSHTML.

 * Added jsimport example (direct from kees's commit message :)

 * Added __pyjamas__.jsimport(path, mode, location)

 * remove dependency of pywin32 in pyjd MSHTML port.

 * improved event handling of pyjd MSHTML port.

 * Added platform overrides system... to pyjd!  MSHTML, hulahop and pywebkitgtk
   can now have their own platform-specific overrides.

 * Added debugger() to __pyjamas__

 * Added javascript inclusion via --include-static-js and __pyjamas__.include()

 * Added dict pop and popitem, thanks to Beni Cherniavsky

 * Added build option --bootstrap-file and a bootstrap_progress.js

 * Discarded strings are not getting translated anymore

 * Added --downloads-(yes/no) to buildall.sh and employeeadmin/build.sh

 * Added experimental support for MSHTML as a Pyjamas Desktop engine

 * Added lightout example from Radoslav Kirov

 * Added if and nested for to list comprehension

 * Added base64 module (not encode/decode file)

 * Added binascii module

 * Added struct module (not pack_into/unpack_from)

 * Added basic support for list comprehension (no ifs/multiple for)

 * Added builtin import test, which will fail if the import code
   gets too smart

 * The -d option now sets:
    --debug-wrap
    --source-tracking
    --line-tracking
    --store-source

 * Bugfix for soure tracking/debugging

 * BUGFIX: the --no-print-statements option was not honored in browser
   linker

 * fixed urllib quote TODO: need real implementation of quote

 * removed deprecated pyjs.py from root of pyjs

 * we now do not need to override pyjamas.Window fully anymore, so use
   base implementation, which now does not import gtk anymore. moved
   pyjamas/__pyjamas__ to /__pyjamas__ again.

 * Added beginnings of urllib (quote, urlencode) thanks to Ondrej Certik

 * Fixed speed issue #199!  was related to accidental inclusion of gtk.py,
   which accidentally pulled in browser.py, gobject.py and much more.
   Thank you to dobee and jukart for identifying the source of the problem.

 * fixed Window listener. Added tests for those

 * moved pyjamas.__pyjamas__ to __pyjamas__, this way the translator
   now removes any import from __pyjamas__ this module is not existent
   in javascript, only in python. if there is a requirement to a
   function in __pyjamas__ in javascript, it does not belong there.

 * added flag handling to overrides for translator, see
   translator.txt. it is now possible to override a whole
   module.

 * fixed pyjamas.Window.getClientWidth/Height on IE. removed
   conditionals from __browser__ implementation in those functions.

 * prevent usage of builtin names in pyjslib, this causes javascript
   errors at least in javascript lint. int and float are now int_
   float_ in javascript. for python code nothing should change.

 * re-added the --cache-buster option, which now also works along with
   --multi-file. both options are now enabled in libtest build.

 * fixed a bug in linker which caused js_libs to be duplicated when
   called twice in a process. this only affects tests, not console
   scripts.

 * added --multi-file option to browser linker to generate script tags
   instead of including the whole code in one file. now it is possible
   to really work with firebug because of the small files. added this
   option to build.sh of libtest by default.

 * fixed browser linker which didn't take js_includes into account

 * use python's standard logging module for displaying messages in the
   linker. The browser linker now takes a -l option for specifying the
   python log level. e.g -l 0 displays all log messages

 * created a new parent platform called "array_extras" which is used
   for "sm", "mozilla", "opera" and "safari" in order to use things
   like Array.indexOf on all browser that suppport the array extras.

 * raise a TranslationError if a reserved word is used for a module
   name, this would cause unpredictable results in running code, which
   is very hard to debug.

 * fixed __contains__ on Tuples in mozilla and added TupleTest to LibTest

 * fixed the "!=" operator, it now uses pyjslib.eq

 * Yi Choong contributed a DateField widget, and example - thank you!

 * Local variables (in functions/methods) are now declared at the
   head of the function/method

 * Compiler option decorators now take the form @compiler.<option>

 * translator is now using unknown properties as module properties
   Take care of this when mixing JS and Python code :
     JS("var a = 1")
     if a == 1:
         pass
   "a" is not know to the translator because it was declared in JS.
   Do this :
     a = None
     JS("a = 1")
   Now a is known to python.

 * #180 - 25% reduction in code output size thanks to Kees moving
   some of the auto-generated code on a per-function basis into
   javascript support routines.

 * #152 - added buttonClick and fixed up CustomButton (see Toggle example)
   at same time.  EVENT.BUTTON_LEFT, BUTTON_MIDDLE, BUTTON_RIGHT had wrong
   #defines as well: only CustomButton was using them which was why nobody
   noticed.

 * Allowed all widget constructors to take kwargs which will result
   in the setXXXX method being called.  Tuples as kwargs will result
   in *args to the setXXXX method e.g.
        p = HorizontalPanel(Size=("600px", "200%"),
                            StyleName="class-name",
                            Visible=False)
   is equivalent to:
        p = HorizontalPanel()
        p.setSize("600px", "100%")
        p.setStyleName("class-name")
        p.setVisible(False)
   This is a strategically very significant upgrade to Pyjamas Widgets:
   it dramatically simplifies the creation of applications.
   Closes #34.

 * Added compile-options --[no-]bound-methods

 * Added augassign for indexed items

 * Whitespace cleanup of addons by stefan schwarzer

 * Extended time module with gmtime/localtime/mktime and partial strftime

 * Tuples no more behave like List. No mutating methods anymore to go
   inline with the pyhton implementation.

 * huge refactoring, with incompatible changes,  see TODO

 * the translator and the linker are now split

 * python packages are now supported

 * translation (not linking) is done on a per-file basis like in
   python, no requirement for existing imports anymore

 * overrides are searched for in a namespace package e.g
   (__mozilla__), this means we can place overrides anywhere in the
   pyjs.path

 * platforms can inherit from others e.g. spidermonkey inherits from
   mozilla (multioverride - no need for runner specific special
   translation like the PyJS hack)

 * public folders are looked up in any directory where a module lives
   - this means the data_directory option is gone

 * pyjs/builtin/public now holds required bootstrap script files

 * there is a dev directory where all scripts from pyjs are now
   generated via normal setup.py and buildout

 * in the dev directory a test script tests the translator, browser-
   and spidermonkey-linker, the spidermonkey linker test actually runs
   examples/libtest

 * builtins now live in pyjs/builtin, those builtins (e.g. pyjslib)
   are transparent from python

 * Patch from Stefan Schwarzer to replace != None with is not None
   and == None with is None, general clean-up.

 * Got SVG 2D Canvas addonsgallery example working under Pyjamas-Desktop
   (Gecko Engine).  Requires a patch to XulRunner, for drawImage to work:
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502234

 * Added libtest corrections thanks to stefan schwarzer

 * Added PureMVC example EmployeeAdmin

 * Added Gecko/XUL/Hulahop as Pyjamas-Desktop engine; added pyjd.setup
   and pyjd.run functions (which are dummy in pyjs); added ~/.pyjd/pyjdrc
   file to configure use of either pywebkitgtk or hulahop

 * int() now raises ValueError

 * Added __getitem__ to Exception

 * Fix for cache-busting in build process with different versions
   of python (use of md5 module), thanks to Oisin Mulvihill

 * Added support for reaching subscript js objects with python syntax

 * Simplified import for pyjs

 * Added isinstance(s, str) and isinstance(s, int) support

 * Monster update to include Pyjamas-Desktop

 * Added imperfect support for local import/from-import

 * Added support for toplevel conditional import/from-import

 * Added name mapping to protect javascript reserved function methods
   and reserved local variables (e.g. .name/.prototype, this/arguments)

 * Revised name (variable/class/function/...) lookup

 * Extended compile option support for commandline building and
   compiling and for function / method decorators

 * Added __repr__() and toString() to list/tuple/dict

 * Disable source-tracking on Modload for better trace dumps

 * Use pyjslib.cmp() for <, <=, >, >= to enable type comparing (tuple/list/dict)

 * Performance improvement pyjslib.eq / pyjslib.cmp

 * Added support for iterable single argument in min()/max()

 * Circular imports permitted

 * Extended try-except support

 * Extended raise statement support

 * Added support for assigning instance methods to variables

 * Bugfix/performance enhancement method argument checking

 * Added Window.setOnError() and Window.onError()

 * Modified debug and tracing

 * Added support for 'for' iteration over slice

 * Added support for function call in global variable

 * Enhancement of import and from statement

 * Added missing imports (bernd)

 * use getattr for listener check in Image implementation (bernd)

 * Bugfix for sprintf (in IE6)

 * Added partial implementation for sys.exc_info()

 * Added extended support for try...except...else

 * Added support for attribute checking, with compiler flag

 * Added missing imports in library (thanks to jukart)

 * Added much better sprintf which has dict support (Yaay!  thank you kees)

 * Added NameError, ValueError and IndexError exceptions (thanks to Kees)

 * Extended string startswith, endswith, added ljust, rjust and center
   (thanks to Kees).

 * Added "pow", "hex", "oct", "round", "divmod", "all", "any" and "delattr".
   (thanks to Kees).

 * Added subscript support and more, from the llpamies branch (lkcl), to
   get pygtk working.

 * Added support for x ** y syntax (thanks to Kees).

 * Fixed getBoundingClientRect off-by-one bug (firefox 3 returns an
   inaccurate float, not an int)  thanks to khiraly

 * Added ToggleButton, PushButton and CustomButton (thanks to khiraly)

 * Added means to return and call functions from another function call
   (added by Kees)

 * Completed DisclosurePanel port


                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.5
                    ---------------------------------

 * Fixed Autocompletion which just needed non-modal on PopupPanel
   (thanks to lovelysystems for implementing non-modal dialogs
    otherwise it wouldn't be possible to fix Autocompletion)

 * Added implementation of metaclass "type" function

 * Made KeyboardListener a singleton module rather than have a class
   named the same as the module.  Likewise with MouseListener, Event
   and Focus.

 * Added Right-clickable Context Menus, and added an example in KitchenSink
   Menus.py to show how to set them up.

 * Added python-spidermonkey as an experimental platform, exactly like
   pyv8run.py now there is pysmrun.py

 * Top-level global variables, and top-level functions, now
   correctly scope in a module (thanks to Jose for raising this one)

 * String constants are now returned as instances of String()
   which results in them having the __iter__ method that has
   been added to the proto of the javascript base String type.

 * made TypeError inherit from BaseException rather than being a
   javascript proto from Error().  TypeError can now be raised
   as an Exception, with a message.

 * made == comparison use __eq__, which conditionally uses __cmp__
   if it is available: this fixes bugs in comparison of lists in the
   LibTest.  replaced a large number of numerical "==" comparisons
   with "is", so that __eq__ doesn't get called (efficiency).

 * added support for calling *args on functions: previously, a call
   function(*args) would result in the args being thrown away!

 * made Tuple its own class, rather than inheriting from List, in order
   that it can be distinguished from List.  __cmp__ of a List with a
   Tuple now correctly fails.

 * rewrote the examples/libtest so that they can be run under standard
   python (python ./LibTest.py).  this allows for a comparison of pyjs
   against standard python.

 * add method extend to pyjslib.List

 * add float to builtins

 * add pyjamas.log based on examples/libtest/write.py

 * registered builtin function 'cmp'. was already implemented but not
   registered in pyjs.py

 * added an --optimize option to which results in removing print
   statements. this could be further improved. e.g. when assert is
   implemented

 * fixed Mozilla "Permission Denied" bug in DOM.isOrHasChild

 * pyjslib.Dict now use the hash method to generate keys internally,
   so it si possible to use objects as keys like in python. For
   limitations on dicts read examples/libtest/DictTest.py

                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.4
                    ---------------------------------

 * convert app "loading" to require the use of "if __name__ == '__main__'"
   bringing pyjamas into line with "standard" python.  apps can convert with
   contrib/pyjamas_0.4-0.5_upgrade/add_name_main.py to add a small codefragment
   at the end: "app = MyApp(); app.onModuleLoad()"

 * added string iterator (for c in "hello")

 * added stacktrace recording and notification when -d option is given
   to builder.  expensive but useful.

 * added a helper tool (in contrib) called replacer.py which helps convert
   apps: "from pyjamas.ui import X,Y" is converted to
   "from pyjamas.ui.X import X; from pyjamas.ui.Y import Y"

 * split ui.py into separate modules.  cache file sizes are now drastically
   reduced due to importing only including what is needed.  the reduction
   is possible with both dynamic and static code-generation, although not
   as much for static.

 * dynamic module loading is now possible (add -m 1 to build).  each module
   is placed in its own separate cache file, with platform overrides
   also getting their own cache file.  cache files are shared between
   platforms rather than four separate identical compiled modules being
   created.  none of this optimisation is possible without dynamic loading

 * added "reverse" method of List. Thanks to Soulburner

 * The user.agent value for Mozilla is no longer "moz", instead
   "mozilla" is returned, to be consistent with platform names.

 * .cache.html files are now generated with their md5 hash in the name
   like in gwt. This now allows to cache those files on the
   browser.  add -c or --cache-buster to builder command-line to enable.

 * all none-native functions always return None now, which matches the
   behaviour of python.

 * implemented "lambda". note that lambdas are only supported without
   kwargs or varargs

 * "while" and "if" statements now use the new "bool" function to
   evaluate their expressions. Now it is possible to do things like
   "if ([])".

 * implemented builtin "bool" function, also the "is" and "is not"
   operators are now generating "===" and "!==", this is needed to
   distinct between undefined and null.

 * added CaptionPanel (see showcase)

 * the pyjs compiler now uses the pyjs.path variable using the same
   semantics as sys.path in python to find python module files to be
   compiled to javascript. the path can also be set via the
   environment variable PYJSPATH

 * Changed development setup to generate ./bin/pyjscompile ./bin/pyjsbuild

 * implemented "isdigit" for strings

 * added support for unicode constants, the encoding is now explicitly
   set in the *.cache.html files to "utf-8". Strings should now be
   encoded in a safer manner.

 * implemented basic Exceptions in pyjslib and added them to the global
   namespace.

 * implemented try except statements with an expression. Raising and
   catching of class based Exceptions is now possible. String based
   Exceptions also work.

 * implemented the 'isinstance' builtin function, currently only
   works on normal class instances.

 * implemented the 'raise' statement. it only works with a single expression.

 * changed 'getattr' to accept a default and raise an AttributeError
   if the attribute cannot be found.

 * implemented 'setattr'

 * added none modal behaviour to DialogBox

 * fixed bug if mouse is moved too fast while dragging a dialog

 * added support for statements at the "global" level in pyjs.py, so
   that compiling "if __name__ == '__main__': " and other such global
   code statements will now work.

                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.3
                    ---------------------------------

Enhancements

 * Added library/splitpanel.py and library/vertsplitpanel.py, along with
  examples/splitpanel.  NOTE: splitpanels should be in ui.

 * Changed ui.TabBar.insertTab() to allow widgets to be passed as well as text.

 * Added examples/tabpanelwidget

 * Added gtk_converter to the "contrib" directory (thanks to Jeremy)

 * Added library/decoratorpanel.py which includes DecoratorPanel,
   DecoratedTabPanel and DecoratedTabBar.  NOTE: these classes should
   be in ui.

 * Added examples/slideshow

 * Added support for slicing with negative numbers.

 * Added examples/jsobject

 * Added support for a debugging mode, which can be turned on by include a "-d"
  command-line option when calling build.py.  With this option turned on, each
  statement in your Python code is surrounded by a try...except statement that
  displays an alert if an exception occurs.  The alert message contains the
  original Python source text, the line number in your Python source file
  where the error occurred, and the details of the Javscript error which
  occurred.  This should greatly simplify debugging your Pyjamas code.

 * Issue #75: Added support for "is not None" syntax.

 * Issue #85: Implemented the repr() built-in function.

 * Issue #93: Implemented dict.items().

 * Issue #95: Implemented Window.prompt().

 * Issue #100: Added a setPadding() method to ui.CellPanel.

 * Issue #103: Implemented the enumerate() built-in function.

 * Issue #104: Added the ability to assign to a list of variables, for example:
  x,y = self.method()

 * Issue #105: Implemented the min() and max() built-in functions.

 * Issue #88: It is now possible to use the getattr() built-in function to
  obtain a method, and then pass parameters to that method when you call it.
  There is a new example in the "examples/" directory, called "getattr", which
  demonstrates how this can be used.

 * Issue #111: Added XOR and bit-shift operators, thanks to legith.

 * Issue #112: Added support for the ord() and chr() built-in functions
  (thanks, legith!).

 * Issue #113: Implemented support for basic try...except statements.  There is
  also a new module, examples/libtest/ExceptionTest.py, which tests the use of
  the try...except statement.


Bug Fixes, etc.

 * Added a new implementation of sprintf.

 * Issue #86: Fixed a bug which could cause HTTPRequest to crash.  Thanks to
  finder83 from code.google.com/p/pyjamas for helping to find this.

 * Added standard images to use for the edges and corners of a dialog box

 * Various changes to ui.py and DOM.py to (partially) support event handling on
  dialog boxes.

 * Fixed a bug in ui.CellFormatter.getElement() which could cause a crash.

 * Fixed a problem with ui.FormSubmitEvent.setCancelled()

 * Fixed bug in ui.clickDelegatePanel.onBrowserEvent() which caused a crash
  when processing a keyDown event.

 * Changed ui.ClickDelegatePanel.onBrowserEvent() to check that the key
  delegate actually has an "onKeyDown" method before attempting to call it.

 * Issue #54: Fixed a probem with browser detection (via the "user-agent"
  string) under Internet Explorer 7.0.  Apparently Microsoft decided to change
  the user-agent string in IE 7, breaking the code in Pyjamas which identified
  the user's browser.

 * Removed code from DOM.init() which was attempting to fix a bug with
  capturing elements, but didn't work.

 * Fixed a bug in ComplexPanel.insert which was causing Internet Explorer 6 to
  corrupt its DOM model.

 * Issue #53: Fixed a problem with operator precedence.

 * Issue #91: Added DOM.eventGetCurrentEvent() function to retrieve the current
  event.

 * Changed FocusWidget.onBrowserEvent() to check that the click listener
  actually has an "onClick" method before attempting to call it.

 * Issue #82: Changed content-type sent by library/HTTPRequest.asyncPostImpl to
  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" rather than "text/plain".  This allows
  the HTTPRequest object to be used to make AJAX calls using HTTP POST
  requests.

 * Issue #81: Fixed library/ui.Panel.clear().

 * Added a cascading stylesheet to the examples/mail program

 * Issue #106: Fixed a problem where using a tuple as a dictionary key produced
  unexpected results

 * Issue #107: It is now possible to include a plus sign at the start of a
  numeric literal

 * Moved datetime.py from the addons directory into library.

 * Issue #80: Changed many of the examples to use the new "pyjamas" package
  name.

 * Fixed a problem with using negative slices on lists (thanks, Legith).
